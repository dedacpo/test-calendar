# Calendar (OpenCage Geocode API and Open WeatherAPI)

This project was developed by Denise Calsavara Paiva de Oliveira for demo proposes and knowledge prove.

It was generated by Angular-CLI and implements the following features:

- [x] Ability to add a new reminder at a chosen date, time, city and color
- [x] Fetch the weather from API for the reminder date and city
- [x] Ability to edit a reminder
- [x] Ability to delete a single reminder
- [x] Ability to delete all reminders from a chosen date
- [x] All the reminders at the same day are displayed at the correct order based on start time
- [x] Render the calendar for any year and month and display the reminders for the dates of the chosen month
- [x] Handle multiples reminders at the same date by transfom each line of reminder to a sequence of squares, and even if that squares doesn't fit the calendar day, a "..." is added indicating that are more reminders to show
- [x] Unit test for the fields at form and the rest of the code, with coverage above 87% for statements, branches, functions and lines
- [x] Handle the data through routes using Ngrx Store


## Considerations
* Each time user loses focus of the city field, a request is made to OpenCage Geocode API (https://opencagedata.com/) to fetch all the cities that matches the query, so the app can use the Lat and Long provided to fetch the weather from Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/).

* The app starts with some mock reminders for demonstration proposes. 

* The mocks are generated based on user's local date and time

* There are two states stored at the ngrx store: the selected year and month; the list of all reminders

* The app is light and fast since it uses Lazy load to handle the routes and modules

* Angular material was used mainly for the forms fields.

* Bootstrap was used to handle the responsive design

* SCSS to set color theme variables and mixins
